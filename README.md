# Cloudflare AI SAAS Stack

A modern starter template for building AI SAAS applications on Cloudflare using:

**Backend:**

- **Hono** (API/backend with ultra-fast routing)
- **Drizzle ORM** (type-safe database queries)
- **Better Auth** (authentication with Google OAuth & email/password)
- **Zod** (schema validation)
- **Cloudflare D1 Database and Workers** (serverless deployment)

**Frontend:**

- **React + Vite** (frontend with hot reload)
- **Tanstack Router** (type-safe routing)
- **Tanstack Query** (powerful data fetching and caching)
- **Tanstack Form** (form handling with validation)
- **Tailwind CSS** (utility-first CSS)
- **Shadcn/ui** (component library)

**Developer Experience:**

- **Biome** (linting and formatting)
- **@cloudflare/vite-plugin** (seamless Cloudflare Workers integration)
- **TypeScript** (type safety throughout)
- **Bun** (package management)
- **Wrangler** (for deployments)

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a new project using this starter kit

```bash
pnpm create cloudflare@latest -- --template vijaynandwani/cloudflare-ai-saas-stack
```

### 2. Change directory and install dependencies

```bash
cd <your-project-name>
bun install
```

### 3. Development

Start the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

- React app runs with hot reload (Vite)
- API runs locally on Cloudflare Workers (Wrangler)
- Both frontend and backend served from the same development server

Your application will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### 4. Database Setup

Create and set up your Cloudflare D1 database:

```bash
bunx wrangler d1 create cloudflare-ai-saas-stack
bun run db:generate
bun run db:migrate
bun run db:migrate:remote
```

### 5. Environment Setup

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Update the values in `.dev.vars` as needed for your local environment:
   ```bash
   BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"
   BETTER_AUTH_URL="http://localhost:5173"
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"
   ```

3. Set up your Google OAuth Client in the Google Cloud Console with the following values:

**Authorized JavaScript origins:**
- http://localhost:5173
- https://your-domain.com

**Authorized redirect URIs:**
- http://localhost:5173/api/auth/callback/google
- https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/google

Be sure that the redirect URIs and origins match exactly in your Google Console and your environment files.


### 6. Build & Deploy

To build and deploy everything to Cloudflare Workers:

```bash
bun run deploy
```

This will:
- Build the React app with Vite
- Deploy the Hono API and static assets to Cloudflare Workers using @cloudflare/vite-plugin

> **⚠️ Note on Email/Password Auth on Cloudflare Free Plan**
>
> Email/password signup or signin may intermittently fail with a `503 cpuExceeded` error when running on the Cloudflare Workers free plan. This is due to resource limitations and is a known issue with the `better-auth` package.
>
> **Solution:**
> - Upgrade to a paid Workers plan for higher CPU limits
> - Or, use Social Login (Google, etc.) for reliable authentication
