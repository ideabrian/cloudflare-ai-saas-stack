Apply the AZOT methodology (Audit → Zone → Optimize → Transfer) to the following problem: $ARGUMENTS

Follow these steps systematically:

1. **AUDIT**: Analyze the current state and identify the problem boundaries
2. **ZONE**: Define the specific area/component to focus on 
3. **OPTIMIZE**: Implement the solution methodically
4. **TRANSFER**: Document the approach for future use

Remember: Patience over urgency. Work systematically, not reactively. Avoid "immediately fix" language.
